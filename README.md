# Todo App

This is a little TodoApp that I'm building with VueJs. I'm trying to build it as legible as possible, with the cleanest code. Through my journey, I will come back to it and apply stuffs that I learned to improve this little app.

# Things to do on the app

- Responsive optimizations
- Keep tasks on localstorage
- Double click on a task to modify it

## Built With

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - The web framework used
- [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/) - Standard Tooling for Vue.js Development
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications.
